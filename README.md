## General info

<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about <b>EngSolver</b>!</summary>
<b>Engsolver</b> is a project aimed at solving various engineering problems. Writen with help of Django and Bootstrap. All modules provide the ability to save, remove, and view results later if the user is logged in.

<p><br>The <b>"Dashboard"</b> module provides an overview and detailed data for all saved calculations.

<p><br>The <b>"Distance Checker"</b> module assesses the minimum distance to the edge of structural connections and presents the results graphically. It takes into account factors such as the type of bolts and the thickness of the plate in the connection, verifying whether there is sufficient space for on-site installation. Logged-in users can save or export results to PDF.

<p><br>The <b>"Bars calculation"</b> is a module that helps calculate and estimate the lightest SHS (Hollow square
cross-section) with limitations on deflection for various forces and markets.
</p>

<p><br>The <b>"Gate calculation"</b> module (future development) will help calculate and estimate the lightest section with limitations on deflection for gates and windows in walls.
